ðŸš€The database was taken frome kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/nasa/astronaut-yearbook

In the Tableau(Software of data visualiztion) was created the dashboard of NASA astronauts.

After seeing of database. I took information on the gender of the astronauts and then I built the first bar graph:

The second graph was "number of astronauts per year" on a line graph:

This dataset contains information like space flight and spacewalks. I built the bubble chart with the best space flight time. This best time is determined by the size of the circle and red colors:

The final graphic is a map of each astronaut's birthplace. This map has dots in each country and the size of each dot shows the number of astronauts that are from the same birthplace.
