After seeing of database. I took information on the gender of the astronauts and then I built the first bar graph:

This dataset contains information like space flight and spacewalks. It is built the bubble chart with the best space flight time. This biggest time is determined by the size of the circle and red colors:

The final graphic is a map of each astronaut's birthplace. This map has dots in each country and the size of each dot shows the number of astronauts that are from the same birthplace.
